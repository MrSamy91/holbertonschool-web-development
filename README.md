# HTML Advanced - Headphone Company Landing Page

## üìã Project Overview

This project involves implementing a webpage from scratch based on a designer file from Figma. The focus is exclusively on **HTML structure and semantics** - no CSS styling or JavaScript functionality will be applied in this phase.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### General HTML Concepts
- What is HTML and its role in web development
- How to create an HTML page from a wireframe or design mockup
- What is a markup language and how HTML functions as one
- Understanding the Document Object Model (DOM)
- The difference between elements and tags
- What are attributes and how they enhance HTML elements
- The specific purpose and semantic meaning of each HTML tag

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### General Guidelines
- All files must end with a new line character
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the project root
- **No external libraries allowed** - pure HTML only
- No CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)
- No JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- No Node.js or build tools
- Code must be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator

### HTML Standards
- Use semantic HTML5 elements where appropriate
- Ensure proper document structure with DOCTYPE declaration
- Maintain proper nesting and hierarchy
- Include necessary meta tags for accessibility and SEO
- Use meaningful class names and IDs for future styling phases

## üé® Design Reference

The design specifications are available on Figma:
- [Page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/...)
- Access the fig file for detailed measurements and specifications
- Remember to "Duplicate to your Drafts" for full design access

### Design Notes
- Missing fonts can be found: `source-sans-pro` and `Spin-Cycle-OT`
- Some values may be in float format - feel free to round them for implementation
- Focus on structure rather than visual appearance at this stage

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: HTML Structure (Current Phase)
1. **Document Setup**
   - Create proper HTML5 document structure
   - Add appropriate meta tags and document head
   - Set up semantic page layout

2. **Content Sections**
   - Header with navigation
   - Hero/banner section
   - Main content areas
   - Footer information

3. **Semantic Elements**
   - Use `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
   - Add meaningful alt text for images
   - Structure forms with proper labels and fieldsets

### Future Phases
- **Phase 2**: CSS Styling and Layout
- **Phase 3**: JavaScript Interactivity
- **Phase 4**: Responsive Design
- **Phase 5**: Performance Optimization

## ‚úÖ Validation Requirements

Before submission, ensure your HTML:
- [ ] Passes W3C HTML Validator without errors
- [ ] Uses semantic HTML5 elements appropriately
- [ ] Has proper document structure and hierarchy
- [ ] Includes all necessary accessibility attributes
- [ ] Contains no inline styles or JavaScript
- [ ] Follows consistent naming conventions

## üîç Key HTML Elements to Implement

Based on typical landing page structure:

### Document Structure
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- `<html>` with appropriate lang attribute
- `<head>` with meta tags, title
- `<body>` with semantic layout

### Content Elements
- Navigation menus with `<nav>` and `<ul>`/`<li>`
- Headings with proper hierarchy
- Paragraphs and text content
- Images with descriptive alt attributes
- Links with meaningful anchor text
- Forms with labels and proper structure

### Semantic Containers
- `<header>` for page header
- `<main>` for primary content
- `<section>` for content sections
- `<article>` for standalone content
- `<aside>` for sidebar content
- `<footer>` for page footer

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/holbertonschool/holbertonschool-web-development.git

## üìù Notes

This project is part of the Holberton School Web Development curriculum, focusing on fundamental HTML skills and semantic markup. The emphasis is on creating clean, accessible, and well-structured HTML that serves as a solid foundation for future styling and functionality phases.

Remember: **HTML first, style later!** Focus on meaning and structure over appearance in this phase.
